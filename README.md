# CS340

Writing maintainable code is really about keeping things organized and separated. In Project One, I built a CRUD module that handled all the database operations in one place, so the dashboard in Project Two could just call simple methods without worrying about how the database worked under the hood. This made debugging easier and means the module could be dropped into future projects — an API, a reporting tool, whatever — without rewriting all that database logic from scratch.
My approach to this project felt different from typical course assignments because there wasn't a clear "right answer" handed to me. I had to take Grazioso Salvare's actual needs — finding animals suited for specific rescue training — and figure out how to translate those into database queries and dashboard filters. That gap between a client's goal and a technical solution is where most of the real thinking happens, and in the future I'd start any similar project by mapping out how the data will be used before deciding how to structure it.
At the end of the day, computer scientists build tools that help people work smarter. Without something like this dashboard, Grazioso Salvare staff would be manually digging through shelter records to find rescue candidates — slow and unreliable. A good database and a clean interface turns that into a quick filter and a map. The work matters because it takes tasks that don't scale and makes them manageable.
